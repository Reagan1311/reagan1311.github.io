I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), working with [Jianfei Yang](https://marsyang.site/) at the [MARS Lab](https://marslab.tech/).
I completed my PhD in 2025 at the University of Edinburgh under the supervision of [Laura Sevilla](https://laurasevilla.me/), and collaborated closely with [Varun Jampani](https://varunjampani.github.io/) and [Deqing Sun](https://deqings.github.io/).
<!-- I also worked as a reserach intern at Huawei London Noah's Ark Lab, mentored by [Kun Shao](https://shaokun91.github.io/). -->

The central focus of my research is to enable robots to perceive and interact with their environments in a human-like yet data-efficient manner. This includes exploring a range of cutting-edge topics:

-	**Multimodal AI**: VLM, MLLM
- **Embodied AI**: Robot Learning, VLA, RL
-	**Generative AI**: Image / Video Generation, World Models
-	**Efficient AI**: Transfer Learning, Learning under Limited Data & Supervision
-	**Human / Robot Interaction**: Human-Object Interaction, Human-to-Robot Learning

ðŸ“¢ I am seeking highly self-motivated PhD, Master, and Bachelor students for potential reserach collaborations. Feel free to contact me via email if you are interested.
